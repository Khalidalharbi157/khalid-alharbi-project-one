  <p>
  I’m a forth year architecture student, and I am learning web design for the first time.
  In the architecture realm, I’m mostly interested in fabrication, small details, and sustainble design.
  Also, being in the architecture program I had the opportunity to learn woodworking in the shop, and I like
  to build my own furniture.

  Outside of architecture, I’m very passionate about analog photography.
  I like to try out vintage cameras, shooting film rolls, and developing them myself. I immensely enjoy
  the extensive long process of making a single image, and it helps me think about my work very differently.
  Recently, I got into making music and sound with modular synthesizers. The complexity and process of tranforming
  sound waves and voltages into rather beautiful melodies is something that I have been experimenting with recently.

  <p>
  I have multiple interest and hobbies. I hope that I would have a very versatile career in different realms: architecture, design, furniture, exhibition,
  photography, music, etc.
