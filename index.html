  I'm a 4th year architecture student, and I am learning web design for the first time.
  In the architecture realm, I'm interested in fabrication, small details, and sustainble design.
  Also, being in the architecture program I got to learn woodworking in the shop, and I like
  to build my own furniture.

  Outside of architecture, I'm passionate about photography, analog photography specifically.
  I like to try out vintage cameras, shooting film rolls, and developing them myself. I enjoy
  the extensive long process of making a single image, and it helps me think about my work very differently.
  Recently, I've got into making music and sound with analog modular synthesizers. The complexity of turning
  frequencies and voltages into beautiful melodies is something that I have been experminting with.

I admire to have a very versatile career in different realms: architecture, design, furniture, exhibition,
photography, music, etc.
