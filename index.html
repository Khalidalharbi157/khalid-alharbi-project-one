  <p>
  I’m a forth year architecture student, and I am learning web design for the
  first time. In the architecture realm, I’m mostly interested in fabrication,
  small details, and sustainble design. Also, being in the architecture program
  I had the opportunity to learn woodworking in the shop, and I like to build my
  own furniture.

  Outside of architecture, I’m very passionate about analog photography.
  I like to try out vintage cameras, shooting film rolls, and developing them
  myself. I immensely enjoy the extensive long process of making a single image,
  and it helps me think about my work very differently. Recently, I got into
  making music and sound with modular synthesizers. The complexity and process
  of tranforming sound waves and voltages into rather beautiful melodies is
  something that I have been experimenting with recently.

  I have multiple interest and hobbies. I hope that I would have a very versatile
  career in different realms: architecture, design, furniture, exhibition,
  photography, music, etc.
